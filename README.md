# maven-hello-world
The initial directory setup is taken from the udemy course, which used IntelliJ to create a new maven project. I used this simple structure as a starting point.

## jar execution
To run the generated jar from the command line use:

```sh
java -jar hello-world-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
